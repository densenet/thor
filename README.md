# thor: three and four combined!

This tool allows you to dynamically generate (and run) geometric algebras.

The main module facilitating this is `src\kgen.luau`.

You can see some sample kernels in `src\common`.

# future work

`thor` must expose a sandbox for toying directly with common kernels as well as generating your own.
